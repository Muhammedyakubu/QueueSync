TODO: 
  - decide if you wanna host the front & backend on a single git repo like last time
    - For now we can have this host both. Using a vanilla javascript


Backend:
- I think MusicKit is client-side SDK so all the calls would need to be made from the client side 
- I guess we would have to define all the classes and stuff on both the client and server side
